/**
 * A class that provides a line reader from an input stream. Depending on the
 * constructor used, lines will either be terminated by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>one of the following: '\n' (LF) , '\r' (CR), or '\r\n' (CR+LF).</li>
 * <li><em>or</em>, a custom byte sequence delimiter</li>
 * </ul>
 * In both cases, EOF also terminates an otherwise unterminated line.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This is a copy from a mapreduce library
 * to allow reading from a stream knowing how
 * much data has been consumed from input stream.
 * Also to strip away need to add all MR libs into
 * classpath.
