== Working with the Hadoop File System

A common task in Hadoop is interacting with its file system, whether for
provisioning, adding new files to be processed, parsing results, or
performing cleanup. Hadoop offers several ways to achieve that: one can
use its Java API (namely {hadoop-FileSystem}[`FileSystem`]
or use the `hadoop` command line, in particular the file system
{hadoop-FileSystemShell}[shell]. However there is no middle ground,
one either has to use the (somewhat verbose, full of checked exceptions)
API or fall back to the command line, outside the application.
SHDP addresses this issue by bridging the
two worlds, exposing both the `FileSystem` and the fs shell through an
intuitive, easy-to-use Java API. Add your favorite
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages[JVM scripting]
language right inside your Spring for Apache Hadoop application and you
have a powerful combination.

=== Configuring the file-system

The Hadoop file-system, HDFS, can be accessed in various ways - this
section will cover the most popular protocols for interacting with HDFS
and their pros and cons. SHDP does not enforce any specific protocol to
be used - in fact, as described in this section any `FileSystem`
implementation can be used, allowing even other implementations than
HDFS to be used.

The table below describes the common HDFS APIs in use:

.HDFS APIs
[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|File System |Comm. Method |Scheme / Prefix |Read / Write |Cross Version
|HDFS |RPC |`hdfs://` |Read / Write |Same HDFS version only
|HFTP |HTTP |`hftp://` |Read only |Version independent
|WebHDFS |HTTP (REST) |`webhdfs://` |Read / Write |Version independent
|=======================================================================

This chapter focuses on the core file-system protocols supported by
Hadoop. S3,
FTP and the rest of the other `FileSystem` implementations are supported as well -
Spring for Apache Hadoop has no dependency on the underlying system
rather just on the public Hadoop API.

`hdfs://` protocol should be familiar to most readers - most docs (and
in fact the previous chapter as well) mention it. It works out of the
box and it's fairly efficient. However because it is RPC based, it
requires both the client and the Hadoop cluster to share the same
version. Upgrading one without the other causes serialization errors
meaning the client cannot interact with the cluster. As an alternative
one can use `hftp://` which is HTTP-based or its more secure brother
`hsftp://` (based on SSL) which gives you a version independent protocol
meaning you can use it to interact with clusters with an unknown or
different version than that of the client. `hftp` is read only (write
operations will fail right away) and it is typically used with `distcp`
for reading data. `webhdfs://` is one of the additions in Hadoop 1.0 and
is a mixture between `hdfs` and `hftp` protocol - it provides a
version-independent, read-write, REST-based protocol which means that
you can read and write to/from Hadoop clusters no matter their version.
Furthermore, since `webhdfs://` is backed by a REST API, clients in
other languages can use it with minimal effort.

[NOTE]
====
Not all file systems work out of the box. For example WebHDFS needs to
be enabled first in the cluster (through `dfs.webhdfs.enabled` property,
see this {hadoop-WebHdfs}[document]
for more information) while the secure `hftp`, `hsftp` requires the SSL
configuration (such as certificates) to be specified. More about this
(and how to use `hftp/hsftp` for proxying) in this {hadoop-Hftp}[page].
====

Once the scheme has been decided upon, one can specify it through the
standard Hadoop <<springandhadoop-config,configuration>>, either
through the Hadoop configuration files or its properties:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:configuration>
  fs.defaultFS=webhdfs://localhost
  ...
</hdp:configuration>
----

This instructs Hadoop (and automatically SHDP) what the default, implied
file-system is. In SHDP, one can create additional file-systems
(potentially to connect to other clusters) and specify a different
scheme:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- manually creates the default SHDP file-system named 'hadoopFs' -->
<hdp:file-system uri="webhdfs://localhost"/>
 
<!-- creates a different FileSystem instance --> 
<hdp:file-system id="old-cluster" uri="hftp://old-cluster/"/>
----

As with the rest of the components, the file systems can be injected
where needed - such as file shell or inside scripts (see the next
section).

=== Using HDFS Resource Loader

In Spring the ResourceLoader interface is meant to be implemented by
objects that can return (i.e. load) Resource instances.

[source,java]
----
public interface ResourceLoader {
  Resource getResource(String location);
}
----

All application contexts implement the ResourceLoader interface, and
therefore all application contexts may be used to obtain Resource
instances.

When you call `getResource()` on a specific application context, and the
location path specified doesn't have a specific prefix, you will get
back a `Resource` type that is appropriate to that particular
application context. For example, assume the following snippet of code
was executed against a ClassPathXmlApplicationContext instance:

[source,java]
----
Resource template = ctx.getResource("some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

What would be returned would be a `ClassPathResource`; if the same
method was executed against a FileSystemXmlApplicationContext instance,
you'd get back a FileSystemResource. For a WebApplicationContext, you'd
get back a ServletContextResource, and so on.

As such, you can load resources in a fashion appropriate to the
particular application context.

On the other hand, you may also force ClassPathResource to be used,
regardless of the application context type, by specifying the special
`classpath:` prefix:

[source,java]
----
Resource template = ctx.getResource("classpath:some/resource/path/myTemplate.txt");
----

[NOTE]
====
More information about the generic usage of resource loading, check the
_Spring Framework Documentation_.
====

`Spring Hadoop` is adding its own functionality into generic concept of
resource loading. Resource abstraction in Spring has always been a way
to ease resource access in terms of not having a need to know where
there resource is and how it's accessed. This abstraction also goes
beyond a single resource by allowing to use patterns to access multiple
resources.

Lets first see how HdfsResourceLoader is used manually.

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:file-system />
<hdp:resource-loader id="loader" file-system-ref="hadoopFs" />
<hdp:resource-loader id="loaderWithUser" user="myuser" uri="hdfs://localhost:8020" />
----

In above configuration we created two beans, one with reference to
existing `Hadoop FileSystem bean` and one with impersonated user.

[source,java]
----
// get path '/tmp/file.txt'
Resource resource = loader.getResource("/tmp/file.txt");
// get path '/tmp/file.txt' with user impersonation
Resource resource = loaderWithUser.getResource("/tmp/file.txt");

// get path '/user/<current user>/file.txt'
Resource resource = loader.getResource("file.txt");
// get path '/user/myuser/file.txt'
Resource resource = loaderWithUser.getResource("file.txt");

// get all paths under '/tmp/'
Resource[] resources = loader.getResources("/tmp/*");
// get all paths under '/tmp/' recursively
Resource[] resources = loader.getResources("/tmp/**/*");
// get all paths under '/tmp/' using more complex ant path matching
Resource[] resources = loader.getResources("/tmp/?ile?.txt");
----

What would be returned in above examples would be instances of
HdfsResources.

If there is a need for _Spring Application Context_ to be aware of
HdfsResourceLoader it needs to be registered using
`hdp:resource-loader-registrar` namespace tag.

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:file-system />
<hdp:resource-loader file-system-ref="hadoopFs" handle-noprefix="false" />
<hdp:resource-loader-registrar />
----

[NOTE]
====
On default the HdfsResourceLoader will handle all resource paths without
prefix. Attribute `handle-noprefix` can be used to control this
behaviour. If this attribute is set to _false_, non-prefixed resource
uris will be handled by _Spring Application Context_.
====

[source,java]
----
// get 'default.txt' from current user's home directory
Resource[] resources = context.getResources("hdfs:default.txt");
// get all files from hdfs root
Resource[] resources = context.getResources("hdfs:/*");
// let context handle classpath prefix
Resource[] resources = context.getResources("classpath:cfg*properties");
----

What would be returned in above examples would be instances of
HdfsResources and ClassPathResource for the last one. If requesting
resource paths without existing prefix, this example would fall back
into _Spring Application Context_. It may be advisable to let
HdfsResourceLoader to handle paths without prefix if your application
doesn't rely on loading resources from underlying context without
prefixes.

=== Scripting the Hadoop API

SHDP scripting supports any
https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223] (also known as
`javax.scripting`) compliant scripting engine. Simply add the engine jar
to the classpath and the application should be able to find it. Most
languages (such as Groovy or JRuby) provide JSR-233 support out of the
box; for those that do not see the
https://java.net/projects/scripting[scripting] project that provides
various adapters.

Since Hadoop is written in Java, accessing its APIs in a _native_ way
provides maximum control and flexibility over the interaction with
Hadoop. This holds true for working with its file systems; in fact all
the other tools that one might use are built upon these. The main entry
point is the org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem abstract class which
provides the foundation of most (if not all) of the actual file system
implementations out there. Whether one is using a local, remote or
distributed store through the FileSystem API she can query and
manipulate the available resources or create new ones. To do so however,
one needs to write Java code, compile the classes and configure them
which is somewhat cumbersome especially when performing simple,
straightforward operations (like copy a file or delete a directory).

JVM scripting languages (such as https://groovy.codehaus.org/[Groovy],
https://www.jruby.org[JRuby], https://www.jython.org/[Jython] or
https://www.mozilla.org/rhino/[Rhino] to name just a few) provide a nice
solution to the Java language; they run on the JVM, can interact with
the Java code with no or few changes or restrictions and have a nicer,
simpler, less _ceremonial_ syntax; that is, there is no need to define a
class or a method - simply write the code that you want to execute and
you are done. SHDP combines the two, taking care of the configuration
and the infrastructure so one can interact with the Hadoop environment
from her language of choice.

Let us take a look at a JavaScript example using Rhino (which is part of
JDK 6 or higher, meaning one does not need any extra libraries):

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" ...>        
  <hdp:configuration .../>
        
  <hdp:script id="inlined-js" language="javascript" run-at-startup="true">
    try {load("nashorn:mozilla_compat.js");} catch (e) {} // for Java 8
    importPackage(java.util);

    name = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
    scriptName = "src/test/resources/test.properties"
    //  - FileSystem instance based on 'hadoopConfiguration' bean
    // call FileSystem#copyFromLocal(Path, Path)  
    .copyFromLocalFile(scriptName, name)
    // return the file length 
    .getLength(name)
  </hdp:script>
     
</beans>
----

The `script` element, part of the SHDP namespace, builds on top of the
scripting support in Spring permitting script declarations to be
evaluated and declared as normal bean definitions. Furthermore it
automatically exposes Hadoop-specific objects, based on the existing
configuration, to the script such as the `FileSystem` (more on that in
the next section). As one can see, the script is fairly obvious: it
generates a random name (using the UUID class from `java.util` package)
and then copies a local file into HDFS under the random name. The last
line returns the length of the copied file which becomes the value of
the declaring bean (in this case `inlined-js`) - note that this might
vary based on the scripting engine used.

[NOTE]
====
The attentive reader might have noticed that the arguments passed to the
FileSystem object are not of type Path but rather String. To avoid the
creation of Path object, SHDP uses a wrapper class `SimplerFileSystem`
which automatically does the conversion so you don't have to. For more
information see the implicit variables section.
====

Note that for inlined scripts, one can use Spring's property placeholder
configurer to automatically expand variables at runtime. Using one of
the examples seen before:

[source,xml]
----
<beans ... >
  <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:hadoop.properties" />
   
  <hdp:script language="javascript" run-at-startup="true">
    ...
    tracker=
    ...
  </hdp:script>
</beans>
----

Notice how the script above relies on the property placeholder to expand
`${hd.fs}` with the values from `hadoop.properties` file available in
the classpath.

As you might have noticed, the `script` element defines a runner for JVM
scripts. And just like the rest of the SHDP runners, it allows one or
multiple `pre` and `post` actions to be specified to be executed before
and after each run. Typically other runners (such as other jobs or
scripts) can be specified but any JDK `Callable` can be passed in. Do
note that the runner will not run unless triggered manually or if
`run-at-startup` is set to `true`. For more information on runners, see
the <<springandhadoop-runners,dedicated>> chapter.

==== Using scripts

Inlined scripting is quite handy for doing simple operations and coupled
with the property expansion is quite a powerful tool that can handle a
variety of use cases. However when more logic is required or the script
is affected by XML formatting, encoding or syntax restrictions (such as
Jython/Python for which white-spaces are important) one should consider
externalization. That is, rather than declaring the script directly
inside the XML, one can declare it in its own file. And speaking of
Python, consider the variation of the previous example:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:script location="org/company/basic-script.py" run-at-startup="true"/>
----

The definition does not bring any surprises but do notice there is no
need to specify the language (as in the case of a inlined declaration)
since script extension (`py`) already provides that information. Just
for completeness, the `basic-script.py` looks as follows:

[source,python]
----
from java.util import UUID
from org.apache.hadoop.fs import Path

print "Home dir is " + str(fs.homeDirectory)
print "Work dir is " + str(fs.workingDirectory)
print "/user exists " + str(fs.exists("/user"))

name = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
scriptName = "src/test/resources/test.properties"
fs.copyFromLocalFile(scriptName, name)
print Path(name).makeQualified(fs)
----

=== Scripting implicit variables

To ease the interaction of the script with its enclosing context, SHDP
binds by default the so-called _implicit_ variables. These are:

.Implicit variables
[width="100%",cols="15%,30%,55%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description

|cfg
|{hadoop-Configuration}[Configuration]
|Hadoop Configuration (relies on _hadoopConfiguration_ bean or singleton type match)

|cl
|{java-ClassLoader}[ClassLoader]
|ClassLoader used for executing the script

|ctx
|{core-ApplicationContext}[ApplicationContext]
|Enclosing application context

|ctxRL
|{core-ResourcePatternResolver}[ResourcePatternResolver]
|Enclosing application context ResourceLoader

|distcp
|{shdp-DistCp}[DistCp]
|Programmatic access to DistCp

|fs
|{hadoop-FileSystem}[FileSystem]
|Hadoop File System (relies on 'hadoop-fs' bean or singleton type match,
falls back to creating one based on 'cfg')

|fsh
|{shdp-FsShell}[FsShell]
|File System shell, exposing hadoop 'fs' commands as an API

|hdfsRL
|{shdp-HdfsResourceLoader}[HdfsResourceLoader]
|Hdfs resource loader (relies on 'hadoop-resource-loader' or singleton type
match, falls back to creating one automatically based on 'cfg')
|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
====
If no Hadoop Configuration can be detected (either by name
hadoopConfiguration or by type), several log warnings will be made and none of the
Hadoop-based variables (namely cfg , distcp , fs , fsh , distcp or hdfsRL) will be bound.
====

As mentioned in the _Description_ column, the variables are first looked
(either by name or by type) in the application context and, in case they
are missing, created on the spot based on the existing configuration.
Note that it is possible to override or add new variables to the scripts
through the `property` sub-element that can set values or references to
other beans:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:script location="org/company/basic-script.js" run-at-startup="true">
   <hdp:property name="foo" value="bar"/>
   <hdp:property name="ref" ref="some-bean"/>
</hdp:script>
----

==== Running scripts

The `script` namespace provides various options to adjust its behaviour
depending on the script content. By default the script is simply
declared - that is, no execution occurs. One however can change that so
that the script gets evaluated at startup (as all the examples in this
section do) through the `run-at-startup` flag (which is by default
`false`) or when invoked manually (through the Callable). Similarily, by
default the script gets evaluated on each run. However for scripts that
are expensive and return the same value every time one has various
_caching_ options, so the evaluation occurs only when needed through the
`evaluate` attribute:

.`script` attributes
[width="100%",cols="18%,16%,66%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Values |Description
|`run-at-startup` |`false`(default), `true` |Wether the script is
executed at startup or not

|`evaluate` |`ALWAYS`(default), `IF_MODIFIED`, `ONCE` |Wether to
actually evaluate the script when invoked or used a previous value.
`ALWAYS` means evaluate every time, `IF_MODIFIED` evaluate if the
backing resource (such as a file) has been modified in the meantime and
`ONCE` only once.
|=======================================================================

==== Using the Scripting tasklet

For Spring Batch environments, SHDP provides a dedicated tasklet to
execute scripts.

[source,xml]
----
<script-tasklet id="script-tasklet">
  <script language="groovy">
    inputPath = "/user/gutenberg/input/word/"
    outputPath = "/user/gutenberg/output/word/"
    if (fsh.test(inputPath)) {
      fsh.rmr(inputPath)
    }
    if (fsh.test(outputPath)) {
      fsh.rmr(outputPath)
    }
    inputFile = "src/main/resources/data/nietzsche-chapter-1.txt"
    fsh.put(inputFile, inputPath)
  </script>
</script-tasklet>
----

The tasklet above embedds the script as a nested element. You can also
declare a reference to another script definition, using the script-ref
attribute which allows you to externalize the scripting code to an
external resource.

[source,xml]
----
<script-tasklet id="script-tasklet" script-ref="clean-up"/>
    <hdp:script id="clean-up" location="org/company/myapp/clean-up-wordcount.groovy"/>
----

=== File System Shell (FsShell)

A handy utility provided by the Hadoop distribution is the file system
{hadoop-FileSystemShell}[shell] which allows UNIX-like commands to be
executed against HDFS. One can check for the existence of files, delete,
move, copy directories or files or set up permissions. However the
utility is only available from the command-line which makes it hard to
use from/inside a Java application. To address this problem, SHDP provides
a lightweight, fully embeddable shell, called `FsShell` which mimics most
of the commands available from the command line: rather than dealing
with `System.in` or `System.out`, one deals with objects.

Let us take a look at using `FsShell` by building on the previous
scripting examples:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:script location="org/company/basic-script.groovy" run-at-startup="true"/>
----

[source,java]
----
name = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
scriptName = "src/test/resources/test.properties"
fs.copyFromLocalFile(scriptName, name)

// use the shell made available under variable 
dir = "script-dir"
if (!fsh.test(dir)) {
   fsh.mkdir(dir); fsh.cp(name, dir); fsh.chmodr(700, dir)
   println "File content is " + fsh.cat(dir + name).toString()
}
println fsh.ls(dir).toString()
fsh.rmr(dir)
----

As mentioned in the previous section, a `FsShell` instance is
automatically created and configured for scripts, under the name _fsh_.
Notice how the entire block relies on the usual commands: `test`,
`mkdir`, `cp` and so on. Their semantics are exactly the same as in the
command-line version however one has access to a native Java API that
returns actual objects (rather than `String`s) making it easy to use
them programmatically whether in Java or another language. Furthermore,
the class offers enhanced methods (such as `chmodr` which stands for
_recursive_ `chmod`) and multiple overloaded methods taking advantage of
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html[varargs]
so that multiple parameters can be specified. Consult the
{shdp-FsShell}[API] for more information.

To be as close as possible to the command-line shell, `FsShell` mimics
even the messages being displayed. Take a look at line 9 which prints
the result of `fsh.cat()`. The method returns a `Collection` of Hadoop
`Path` objects (which one can use programatically). However when
invoking `toString` on the collection, the same printout as from the
command-line shell is being displayed:

----------------
File content is 
----------------

The same goes for the rest of the methods, such as `ls`. The same script
in JRuby would look something like this:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'java'
name = java.util.UUID.randomUUID().to_s
scriptName = "src/test/resources/test.properties"
$fs.copyFromLocalFile(scriptName, name)

# use the shell
dir = "script-dir/"
...
print $fsh.ls(dir).to_s
----

which prints out something like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwx------   - user     supergroup          0 2012-01-26 14:08 /user/user/script-dir
-rw-r--r--   3 user     supergroup        344 2012-01-26 14:08 /user/user/script-dir/520cf2f6-a0b6-427e-a232-2d5426c2bc4e
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, not only can you reuse the existing tools and commands
with Hadoop inside SHDP, but you can also code against them in various
scripting languages. And as you might have noticed, there is no special
configuration required - this is automatically inferred from the
enclosing application context.

[NOTE]
====
The careful reader might have noticed that besides the syntax, there are
some minor differences in how the various languages interact with the
java objects. For example the automatic toString call called in Java for doing automatic String
conversion is not necessarily supported (hence the to_s in Ruby or str
in Python). This is to be expected as each language has its own
semantics - for the most part these are easy to pick up but do pay
attention to details.
====

==== DistCp API

Similar to the `FsShell`, SHDP provides a lightweight, fully embeddable
https://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/stable/distcp.html[`DistCp`]
version that builds on top of the `distcp` from the Hadoop distro. The
semantics and configuration options are the same however, one can use it
from within a Java application without having to use the command-line.
See the {shdp-DistCp}[API] for more information:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:script language="groovy">distcp.copy("${distcp.src}", "${distcp.dst}")</hdp:script>
----

The bean above triggers a distributed copy relying again on Spring's
property placeholder variable expansion for its source and destination.
