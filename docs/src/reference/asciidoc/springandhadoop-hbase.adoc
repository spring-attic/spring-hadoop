== Working with HBase

SHDP provides basic configuration for https://hbase.apache.org[HBase]
through the `hbase-configuration` namespace element (or its backing
HbaseConfigurationFactoryBean).

[source,xml]
----
<!-- default bean id is 'hbaseConfiguration' that uses the existing 'hadoopCconfiguration' object -->
<hdp:hbase-configuration configuration-ref="hadoopCconfiguration" />
----

The above declaration does more than easily create an HBase
configuration object; it will also manage the backing HBase connections:
when the application context shuts down, so will any HBase connections
opened - this behavior can be adjusted through the `stop-proxy` and
`delete-connection` attributes:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- delete associated connections but do not stop the proxies -->
<hdp:hbase-configuration stop-proxy="false" delete-connection="true">
  foo=bar
  property=value
</hdp:hbase-configuration>
----

Additionally, one can specify the ZooKeeper port used by the HBase
server - this is especially useful when connecting to a remote instance
(note one can fully configure HBase including the ZooKeeper host and
port through properties; the attributes here act as shortcuts for easier
declaration):

[source,xml]
----
<!-- specify ZooKeeper host/port -->
<hdp:hbase-configuration zk-quorum="${hbase.host}" zk-port="${hbase.port}">
----

Notice that like with the other elements, one can specify additional
properties specific to this configuration. In fact `hbase-configuration`
provides the same properties configuration `knobs` as
<<springandhadoop-config, hadoop configuration>>:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:hbase-configuration properties-ref="some-props-bean" properties-location="classpath:/conf/testing/hbase.properties"/>

=== Data Access Object (DAO) Support

One of the most popular and powerful feature in Spring Framework is the
Data Access Object (or DAO) {core-dao}[support].
It makes dealing with data access technologies easy and consistent
allowing easy switch or interconnection of the aforementioned persistent
stores with minimal friction (no worrying about catching exceptions,
writing boiler-plate code or handling resource acquisition and
disposal). Rather than reiterating here the value proposal of the DAO
support, we recommend the JDBC {core-jdbc}[section]
in the Spring Framework reference documentation

SHDP provides the same functionality for Apache HBase through its
`org.springframework.data.hadoop.hbase` package: an `HbaseTemplate`
along with several callbacks such as `TableCallback`, `RowMapper` and
`ResultsExtractor` that remove the low-level, tedious details for
finding the HBase table, run the query, prepare the scanner, analyze the
results then clean everything up, letting the developer focus on her
actual job (users familiar with Spring should find the class/method
names quite familiar).

At the core of the DAO support lies `HbaseTemplate` - a high-level
abstraction for interacting with HBase. The template requires an HBase
<<springandhadoop-hbase,configuration>>, once it's set, the template is thread-safe
and can be reused across multiple instances at the same time:

[source,xml]
----
// default HBase configuration
<hdp:hbase-configuration/>

// wire hbase configuration (using default name 'hbaseConfiguration') into the template 
<bean id="htemplate" class="org.springframework.data.hadoop.hbase.HbaseTemplate" p:configuration-ref="hbaseConfiguration"/>
----

The template provides generic callbacks, for executing logic against the
tables or doing result or row extraction, but also utility methods (the
so-called _one-liner_s) for common operations. Below are some examples
of how the template usage looks like:

[source,java]
----
// writing to 'MyTable'
template.execute("MyTable", new TableCallback<Object>() {
  @Override
  public Object doInTable(HTable table) throws Throwable {
    Put p = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("SomeRow"));
    p.add(Bytes.toBytes("SomeColumn"), Bytes.toBytes("SomeQualifier"), Bytes.toBytes("AValue"));
    table.put(p);
    return null;
  }
});
----

[source,java]
----
// read each row from 'MyTable'
List<String> rows = template.find("MyTable", "SomeColumn", new RowMapper<String>() {
  @Override
  public String mapRow(Result result, int rowNum) throws Exception {
    return result.toString();
  }
}));
----

The first snippet showcases the generic `TableCallback` - the most
generic of the callbacks, it does the table lookup and resource cleanup
so that the user code does not have to. Notice the callback signature -
any exception thrown by the HBase API is automatically caught, converted
to Spring's {core-dao-exceptions}[DAO exceptions] and resource clean-up
applied transparently. The second example, displays the dedicated lookup
methods - in this case `find` which, as the name implies, finds all the
rows matching the given criteria and allows user code to be executed against
each of them (typically for doing some sort of type conversion or mapping).
If the entire result is required, then one can use `ResultsExtractor` instead
of `RowMapper`.

Besides the template, the package offers support for automatically
binding HBase table to the current thread through `HbaseInterceptor` and
`HbaseSynchronizationManager`. That is, each class that performs DAO
operations on HBase can be {core-aop-schema-advisors}[_wrapped_]
by `HbaseInterceptor` so that each table in use, once found, is bound to
the thread so any subsequent call to it avoids the lookup. Once the call
ends, the table is automatically closed so there is no leakage between
requests. Please refer to the Javadocs for more information.
