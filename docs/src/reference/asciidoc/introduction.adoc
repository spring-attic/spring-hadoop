= Introduction

Spring for Apache Hadoop provides integration with the Spring Framework
to create and run Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, and Pig jobs as well as work
with HDFS and HBase. If you have simple needs to work with Hadoop,
including basic scheduling, you can add the Spring for Apache Hadoop
namespace to your Spring based project and get going quickly using
Hadoop. As the complexity of your Hadoop application increases, you may
want to use Spring Batch and Spring Integration to regain on the
complexity of developing a large Hadoop application.

This document is the reference guide for Spring for Apache Hadoop
project (SHDP). It explains the relationship between the Spring
framework and Hadoop as well as related projects such as Spring Batch
and Spring Integration. The first part describes the integration with
the Spring framework to define the base concepts and semantics of the
integration and how they can be used effectively. The second part
describes how you can build upon these base concepts and create workflow
based solutions provided by the integration with Spring Batch.

== Requirements

Spring for Apache Hadoop is built and tested with JDK 7,
http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/[Spring Framework] 4.2 and is
by default built against http://hadoop.apache.org/[Apache Hadoop] 2.6.0.

Spring for Apache Hadoop supports the following versions and
distributions:

* http://hadoop.apache.org/[Apache Hadoop] 2.6.0
* http://www.pivotal.io/[Pivotal] HD 2.1
* http://www.pivotal.io/[Pivotal] HD 3.0
* http://www.cloudera.com/[Cloudera] CDH5
* http://www.hortonworks.com/[Hortonworks] Data Platform 2.2

Any distribution compatible with Apache Hadoop 2.2.x or later should be
usable.

Spring for Apache Hadoop is tested daily against a number of Hadoop
distributions. See the
https://build.spring.io/browse/SPRINGDATAHADOOP[test plan page] for
current status.

Instructions for setting up project builds using various supported
distributions are provided on the Spring for Apache Hadoop wiki -
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop/wiki

Regarding Hadoop-related projects, SHDP supports
http://hbase.apache.org/[HBase] 0.94.11, http://hive.apache.org/[Hive]
0.11.0 and http://pig.apache.org/[Pig] 0.11.0 and above. As a rule of
thumb, when using Hadoop-related projects, such as Hive or Pig, use the
required Hadoop version as a basis for discovering the supported
versions.

To take full advantage of Spring for Apache Hadoop you need a running
Hadoop cluster. If you don't already have one in your environment, a
good first step is to create a single-node cluster. To install the most
recent stable verision of Hadoop, the
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/stable/#Getting+Started[Getting
Started] page from the official Apache project is a good general
guide. There should be a link for "Single Node Setup".

It is also convenient to download a Virtual Machine where Hadoop is
setup and ready to go. Cloudera, Hortonworks and Pivotal all provide
virtual machines and provide VM downloads on their product pages.
