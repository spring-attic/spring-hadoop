== MapReduce and Distributed Cache

=== Creating a Hadoop Job

Once the Hadoop configuration is taken care of, one needs to actually
submit some work to it. SHDP makes it easy to configure and run Hadoop
jobs whether they are vanilla map-reduce type or streaming. Let us start
with an example:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:job id="mr-job" 
  input-path="/input/" output-path="/ouput/"
  mapper="org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount.TokenizerMapper"
  reducer="org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount.IntSumReducer"/>
----

The declaration above creates a typical Hadoop `Job`: specifies its
input and output, the mapper and the reducer classes. Notice that there
is no reference to the Hadoop configuration above - that's because, if
not specified, the default naming convention (`hadoopConfiguration`)
will be used instead. Neither is there to the key or value types - these
two are automatically determined through a best-effort attempt by
analyzing the class information of the mapper and the reducer. Of
course, these settings can be overridden: the former through the
`configuration-ref` element, the latter through `key` and `value`
attributes. There are plenty of options available not shown in the
example (for simplicity) such as the jar (specified directly or by
class), sort or group comparator, the combiner, the partitioner, the
codecs to use or the input/output format just to name a few - they are
supported, just take a look at the SHDP schema (?) or simply trigger
auto-completion (usually `CTRL+SPACE`) in your IDE; if it supports XML
namespaces and is properly configured it will display the available
elements. Additionally one can extend the default Hadoop configuration
object and add any special properties not available in the namespace or
its backing bean (JobFactoryBean).

It is worth pointing out that per-job specific configurations are
supported by specifying the custom properties directly or referring to
them (more information on the pattern is available
#hadoop:config:properties[here]):

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:job id="mr-job" 
  input-path="/input/" output-path="/ouput/"
  mapper="mapper class" reducer="reducer class"
  jar-by-class="class used for jar detection"
  properties-location="classpath:special-job.properties">
    electric=sea
</hdp:job>
----

`<hdp:job>` provides additional properties, such as the
#hadoop:generic-options[generic options], however one that is worth
mentioning is `jar` which allows a job (and its dependencies) to be
loaded entirely from a specified jar. This is useful for isolating jobs
and avoiding classpath and versioning collisions. Note that provisioning
of the jar into the cluster still depends on the target environment -
see the aforementioned #hadoop:generic-options[section] for more info
(such as `libs`).

==== Creating a Hadoop Streaming Job

Hadoop {hadoop-Streaming}[Streaming] job (or in short streaming),
is a popular feature of Hadoop as it allows
the creation of Map/Reduce jobs with any executable or script (the
equivalent of using the previous counting words example is to use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%2528Unix%2529[`cat`] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_%2528Unix%2529[`wc`] commands). While it is
rather easy to start up streaming from the command line, doing so
programatically, such as from a Java environment, can be challenging due
to the various number of parameters (and their ordering) that need to be
parsed. SHDP simplifies such a task - it's as easy and straightforward
as declaring a `job` from the previous section; in fact most of the
attributes will be the same:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:streaming id="streaming" 
  input-path="/input/" output-path="/ouput/"
  mapper="${path.cat}" reducer="${path.wc}"/>
----

Existing users might be wondering how they can pass the command line
arguments (such as `-D` or `-cmdenv`). While the former customize the
Hadoop configuration (which has been convered in the previous
#hadoop:config[section]), the latter are supported through the `cmd-env`
element:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:streaming id="streaming-env" 
  input-path="/input/" output-path="/ouput/"
  mapper="${path.cat}" reducer="${path.wc}">
  <hdp:cmd-env>
     EXAMPLE_DIR=/home/example/dictionaries/
     ...
  </hdp:cmd-env>
</hdp:streaming>
----

Just like `job`, `streaming` supports the
#hadoop:generic-options[generic options]; follow the link for more
information.

=== Running a Hadoop Job

The jobs, after being created and configured, need to be submitted for
execution to a Hadoop cluster. For non-trivial cases, a coordinating,
workflow solution such as Spring Batch is recommended . However for
basic job submission SHDP provides the `job-runner` element (backed by
JobRunner class) which submits several jobs sequentially (and waits by
default for their completion):

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:job-runner id="myjob-runner" pre-action="cleanup-script" post-action="export-results" job-ref="myjob" run-at-startup="true"/>

<hdp:job id="myjob"  input-path="/input/" output-path="/output/"
    mapper="org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount.TokenizerMapper"
    reducer="org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount.IntSumReducer" />
----

Multiple jobs can be specified and even nested if they are not used
outside the runner:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:job-runner id="myjobs-runner" pre-action="cleanup-script" job-ref="myjob1, myjob2" run-at-startup="true"/>
    
<hdp:job id="myjob1"  ... />
<hdp:streaming id="myjob2"  ... />
----

One or multiple Map-Reduce jobs can be specified through the `job`
attribute in the order of the execution. The runner will trigger the
execution during the application start-up (notice the `run-at-startup`
flag which is by default `false`). Do note that the runner will not run
unless triggered manually or if `run-at-startup` is set to `true`.
Additionally the runner (as in fact do all
<<springandhadoop-runners,runners>> in
SHDP) allows one or multiple `pre` and `post` actions to be specified to
be executed before and after each run. Typically other runners (such as
other jobs or scripts) can be specified but any JDK `Callable` can be
passed in. For more information on runners, see the
<<springandhadoop-runners,dedicated>> chapter.

[NOTE]
====
As the Hadoop job submission and execution (when wait-for-completion
is true) is blocking, JobRunner uses a JDK Executor to start (or stop)
a job. The default implementation, SyncTaskExecutor uses the calling
thread to execute the job, mimicking the hadoop command line behaviour.
However, as the hadoop jobs are time-consuming, in some cases this can
lead to application freeze, preventing normal operations or even
application shutdown from occuring properly. Before going into production,
it is recommended to double-check whether this strategy is suitable or
whether a throttled or pooled implementation is better. One can customize
the behaviour through the executor-ref parameter.
====

The job runner also allows running jobs to be cancelled (or killed) at
shutdown. This applies only to jobs that the runner waits for
(`wait-for-completion` is `true`) using a different executor then the
default - that is, using a different thread then the calling one (since
otherwise the calling thread has to wait for the job to finish first
before executing the next task). To customize this behaviour, one should
set the `kill-job-at-shutdown` attribute to `false` and/or change the
`executor-ref` implementation.

==== Using the Hadoop Job tasklet

For Spring Batch environments, SHDP provides a dedicated tasklet to
execute Hadoop jobs as a step in a Spring Batch workflow. An example
declaration is shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:job-tasklet id="hadoop-tasklet" job-ref="mr-job" wait-for-completion="true" />
----

The tasklet above references a Hadoop job definition named "mr-job". By
default, `wait-for-completion` is true so that the tasklet will wait for
the job to complete when it executes. Setting `wait-for-completion` to
`false` will submit the job to the Hadoop cluster but not wait for it to
complete.

=== Running a Hadoop Tool

It is common for Hadoop utilities and libraries to be started from the
command-line (ex: `hadoop jar` _some.jar_). SHDP offers generic support
for such cases provided that the packages in question are built on top
of Hadoop standard infrastructure, namely Tool and ToolRunner classes.
As opposed to the command-line usage, Tool instances benefit from
Spring's IoC features; they can be parameterized, created and destroyed
on demand and have their properties (such as the Hadoop configuration)
injected.

Consider the typical `jar` example - invoking a class with some (two in
this case) arguments (notice that the Hadoop configuration properties
are passed as well):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bin/hadoop jar -conf hadoop-site.xml -jt darwin:50020 -Dproperty=value someJar.jar  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since SHDP has first-class support for #hadoop:config[configuring]
Hadoop, the so called `generic options` aren't needed any more, even
more so since typically there is only one Hadoop configuration per
application. Through `tool-runner` element (and its backing `ToolRunner`
class) one typically just needs to specify the `Tool` implementation and
its arguments:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:tool-runner id="someTool" tool-class="org.foo.SomeTool" run-at-startup="true">
   <hdp:arg value="data/in.txt"/>
   <hdp:arg value="data/out.txt"/>
   
   property=value
</hdp:tool-runner>
----

Additionally the runner (just like the job runner) allows one or
multiple `pre` and `post` actions to be specified to be executed before
and after each run. Typically other runners (such as other jobs or
scripts) can be specified but any JDK `Callable` can be passed in. Do
note that the runner will not run unless triggered manually or if
`run-at-startup` is set to `true`. For more information on runners, see
the <<springandhadoop-runners,dedicated>> chapter.

The previous example assumes the `Tool` dependencies (such as its class)
are available in the classpath. If that is not the case, `tool-runner`
allows a jar to be specified:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:tool-runner ... jar="myTool.jar">
    ...
</hdp:tool-runner>
----

The jar is used to instantiate and start the tool - in fact all its
dependencies are loaded from the jar meaning they no longer need to be
part of the classpath. This mechanism provides proper isolation between
tools as each of them might depend on certain libraries with different
versions; rather then adding them all into the same app (which might be
impossible due to versioning conflicts), one can simply point to the
different jars and be on her way. Note that when using a jar, if the
main class (as specified by the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/appman.html[Main-Class]
entry) is the target Tool, one can skip specifying the tool as it will
picked up automatically.

Like the rest of the SHDP elements, `tool-runner` allows the passed
Hadoop configuration (by default `hadoopConfiguration` but specified in
the example for clarity) to be #hadoop:config:properties[customized]
accordingly; the snippet only highlights the property initialization for
simplicity but more options are available. Since usually the `Tool`
implementation has a default argument, one can use the `tool-class`
attribute. However it is possible to refer to another `Tool` instance or
declare a nested one:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:tool-runner id="someTool" run-at-startup="true">
   <hdp:tool>
      <bean class="org.foo.AnotherTool" p:input="data/in.txt" p:output="data/out.txt"/>
   </hdp:tool>
</hdp:tool-runner>
----

This is quite convenient if the `Tool` class provides setters or richer
constructors. Note that by default the `tool-runner` does not execute
the `Tool` until its definition is actually called - this behavior can
be changed through the `run-at-startup` attribute above.

==== Replacing Hadoop shell invocations with tool-runner

`tool-runner` is a nice way for migrating series or shell invocations or
scripts into fully wired, managed Java objects. Consider the following
shell script:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hadoop jar job1.jar -files fullpath:props.properties -Dconfig=config.properties ...
hadoop jar job2.jar arg1 arg2...
...
hadoop jar job10.jar ...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each job is fully contained in the specified jar, including all the
dependencies (which might conflict with the ones from other jobs).
Additionally each invocation might provide some generic options or
arguments but for the most part all will share the same configuration
(as they will execute against the same cluster).

The script can be fully ported to SHDP, through the `tool-runner`
element:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:tool-runner id="job1" tool-class="job1.Tool" jar="job1.jar" files="fullpath:props.properties" properties-location="config.properties"/>
<hdp:tool-runner id="job2" jar="job2.jar">
   <hdp:arg value="arg1"/>
   <hdp:arg value="arg2"/>
</hdp:tool-runner>
<hdp:tool-runner id="job3" jar="job3.jar"/>
...
----

All the features have been explained in the previous sections but let us
review what happens here. As mentioned before, each tool gets autowired
with the `hadoopConfiguration`; `job1` goes beyond this and uses its own
properties instead. For the first jar, the Tool class is specified,
however the rest assume the jar _Main-Class_es implement the Tool
interface; the namespace will discover them automatically and use them
accordingly. When needed (such as with `job1`), additional files or libs
are provisioned in the cluster. Same thing with the job arguments.

However more things that go beyond scripting, can be applied to this
configuration - each job can have multiple properties loaded or declared
inlined - not just from the local file system, but also from the
classpath or any url for that matter. In fact, the whole configuration
can be externalized and parameterized (through Spring's
{core-beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer}[property placeholder]
and/or
{core-beans-environment}[Environment abstraction]). Moreover, each job
can be ran by itself (through the JobRunner) or as part of
a workflow - either through Spring's `depends-on` or the much more powerful
Spring Batch and `tool-tasklet`.

==== Using the Hadoop Tool tasklet

For Spring Batch environments, SHDP provides a dedicated tasklet to
execute Hadoop tasks as a step in a Spring Batch workflow. The tasklet
element supports the same configuration options as
#hadoop:tool-runner[tool-runner] except for `run-at-startup` (which does
not apply for a workflow):

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:tool-tasklet id="tool-tasklet" tool-ref="some-tool" />
----

=== Running a Hadoop Jar

SHDP also provides support for executing vanilla Hadoop jars. Thus the
famous {hadoop-WordCount}[WordCount] example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bin/hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount /wordcount/input /wordcount/output
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

becomes

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:jar-runner id="wordcount" jar="hadoop-examples.jar" run-at-startup="true">
    <hdp:arg value="wordcount"/>
    <hdp:arg value="/wordcount/input"/>
    <hdp:arg value="/wordcount/output"/>
</hdp:jar-runner>
----

[NOTE]
====
Just like the hadoop jar command, by default the jar support reads the jar's
Main-Class if none is specified. This can be customized through the
main-class attribute.
====

Additionally the runner (just like the job runner) allows one or
multiple `pre` and `post` actions to be specified to be executed before
and after each run. Typically other runners (such as other jobs or
scripts) can be specified but any JDK `Callable` can be passed in. Do
note that the runner will not run unless triggered manually or if
`run-at-startup` is set to `true`. For more information on runners, see
the <<springandhadoop-runners,dedicated>> chapter.

The `jar support` provides a nice and easy migration path from jar
invocations from the command-line to SHDP (note that Hadoop
#hadoop:generic-options[generic options] are also supported). Especially
since SHDP enables Hadoop `Configuration` objects, created during the
jar execution, to automatically inherit the context Hadoop
configuration. In fact, just like other SHDP elements, the `jar` element
allows #hadoop:config:properties[configurations properties] to be
declared locally, just for the jar run. So for example, if one would use
the following declaration:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:jar-runner id="wordcount" jar="hadoop-examples.jar" run-at-startup="true">
    <hdp:arg value="wordcount"/>
    ...
    speed=fast
</hdp:jar-runner>
----

inside the jar code, one could do the following:

[source,java]
----
assert "fast".equals(new Configuration().get("speed"));
----

This enabled basic Hadoop jars to use, without changes, the enclosing
application Hadoop configuration.

And while we think it is a useful feature (that is why we added it in
the first place), we strongly recommend using the tool support instead
or migrate to it; there are several reasons for this mainly because
there are _no contracts_ to use, leading to very poor embeddability
caused by:

* No standard `Configuration` injection
+
While SHDP does a best effort to pass the Hadoop configuration to the
jar, there is no guarantee the jar itself does not use a special
initialization mechanism, ignoring the passed properties. After all, a
vanilla `Configuration` is not very useful so applications tend to
provide custom code to address this.
* `System.exit()` calls
+
Most jar examples out there (including `WordCount`) assume they are
started from the command line and among other things, call
`System.exit`, to shut down the JVM, whether the code is succesful or
not. SHDP prevents this from happening (otherwise the entire application
context would shutdown abruptly) but it is a clear sign of poor code
collaboration.

SHDP tries to use sensible defaults to provide the best integration
experience possible but at the end of the day, without any contract in
place, there are no guarantees. Hence using the `Tool` interface is a
much better alternative.

==== Using the Hadoop Jar tasklet

Like for the rest of its tasks, for Spring Batch environments, SHDP
provides a dedicated tasklet to execute Hadoop jars as a step in a
Spring Batch workflow. The tasklet element supports the same
configuration options as #hadoop:jar-runner[jar-runner] except for
`run-at-startup` (which does not apply for a workflow):

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:jar-tasklet id="jar-tasklet" jar="some-jar.jar" />
----

=== Configuring the Hadoop DistributedCache

{hadoop-DistributedCache}[DistributedCache]
is a Hadoop facility for distributing application-specific, large,
read-only files (text, archives, jars and so on) efficiently.
Applications specify the files to be cached via urls (`hdfs://`) using
`DistributedCache` and the framework will copy the necessary files to
the slave nodes before any tasks for the job are executed on that node.
Its efficiency stems from the fact that the files are only copied once
per job and the ability to cache archives which are un-archived on the
slaves. Note that `DistributedCache` assumes that the files to be cached
(and specified via hdfs:// urls) are already present on the Hadoop
`FileSystem`.

SHDP provides first-class configuration for the distributed cache
through its `cache` element (backed by DistributedCacheFactoryBean
class), allowing files and archives to be easily distributed across
nodes:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:cache create-symlink="true">
   <hdp:classpath value="/cp/some-library.jar#library.jar" />
   <hdp:cache value="/cache/some-archive.tgz#main-archive" />
   <hdp:cache value="/cache/some-resource.res" />
   <hdp:local value="some-file.txt" />
</hdp:cache>
----

The definition above registers several resources with the cache (adding
them to the job cache or classpath) and creates symlinks for them. As
described in the `DistributedCache` {hadoop-DistributedCache}[documentation]
the declaration format is (`absolute-path#link-name`). The link name is
determined by the URI fragment (the text following the # such as
_#library.jar_ or _#main-archive_ above) - if no name is specified, the
cache bean will infer one based on the resource file name. Note that one
does not have to specify the `hdfs://node:port` prefix as these are
automatically determined based on the configuration wired into the bean;
this prevents environment settings from being hard-coded into the
configuration which becomes portable. Additionally based on the resource
extension, the definition differentiates between archives (`.tgz`,
`.tar.gz`, `.zip` and `.tar`) which will be uncompressed, and regular
files that are copied as-is. As with the rest of the namespace
declarations, the definition above relies on defaults - since it
requires a Hadoop `Configuration` and `FileSystem` objects and none are
specified (through `configuration-ref` and `file-system-ref`) it falls
back to the default naming and is wired with the bean named
_hadoopConfiguration_, creating the `FileSystem` automatically.

[WARNING]
====
Clients setting up a classpath in the DistributedCache, running on Windows
platforms should set the System `path.separator` property to `:`. Otherwise
the classpath will be set incorrectly and will be ignored; see HADOOP-9123
bug report for more information. There are multiple ways to change the
`path.separator` `System` property - a quick one being a simple `script`
in Javascript (that uses the Rhino package bundled with the JDK)
that runs at start-up:

[source,xml]
----
<hdp:script language="javascript" run-at-startup="true">
    // set System 'path.separator' to ':' - see HADOOP-9123
    java.lang.System.setProperty("path.separator", ":")
</hdp:script>
----
====

=== Map Reduce Generic Options
 
The `job`, `streaming` and `tool` all support a subset of _generic
options_, specifically `archives`, `files` and `libs`. `libs` is
probably the most useful as it enriches a job classpath (typically with
some jars) - however the other two allow resources or archives to be
copied throughout the cluster for the job to consume. Whenver faced with
provisioning issues, revisit these options as they can help up
significantly. Note that the `fs`, `jt` or `conf` options are not
supported - these are designed for command-line usage, for bootstrapping
the application. This is no longer needed, as the SHDP offers
first-class support for defining and customizing Hadoop
<<springandhadoop-config,configurations>>.
