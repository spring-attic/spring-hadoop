  <title>Requirements</title>

  <para>Spring for Apache Hadoop requires JDK level 6.0 (just like Hadoop) and above,
  Spring <ulink url="http://www.springsource.org/about">Framework</ulink> 3.0
  (3.2 recommended) and above and <ulink
  url="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</ulink> 0.20.2
  (1.0.4 recommended) and above. SHDP supports and is <ulink url="https://build.springsource.org/browse/SPRINGDATAHADOOP">tested</ulink> daily 
  against various Hadoop distributions, such as
  <ulink url="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</ulink> CDH3 (CD3u5) and
  CDH4 (CDH4.1u3 MRv1) distributions and <ulink url="http://www.greenplum.com/">Greenplum</ulink>
  HD (1.2). Any distro compatible with Apache Hadoop 1.0.x should be supported.</para>
  <para>Spring Data Hadoop is provided out of the box and it is certified to work on Greenplum/Pivotal
  HD distribution.</para>
  
  <warning>Note that Hadoop YARN, NextGen or 2.x (currently in alpha stage), is NOT supported yet. Some
  Hadoop distros offer both the stable Hadoop (also known as 1.x or MRv1) and the YARN variant
  (also known as 2.x or MRv2) bundled together. Since SHDP supports only Hadoop 1.x, make sure to use <emphasis>only</emphasis>
  the 1.x/MRv1 services and libraries both on the clients and server, as 2.x/MRv2, or a mixture of the two,
  will cause errors.</warning>

  <para>
  Regarding Hadoop-related projects, SDHP
  supports <ulink url="http://cascading.org/">Cascading</ulink> 2.1, 
  <ulink url="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</ulink> 0.90.x, <ulink
  url="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</ulink> 0.8.x and <ulink
  url="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</ulink> 0.9.x and above. As a rule of
  thumb, when using Hadoop-related projects, such as Hive or Pig, use the
  required Hadoop version as a basis for discovering the supported
  versions.</para>

  <para>Spring for Apache Hadoop also requires a Hadoop installation up and
  running. If you don't already have a Hadoop cluster up and running in your
  environment, a good first step is to create a single-node cluster. To
  install Hadoop 0.20.x+, the <link
  ns6:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/stable/#Getting+Started">Getting
  Started</link> page from the official Apache documentation is a good general guide.
  If you are running on Ubuntu, the tutorial from Michael G. Noll, "<link
  ns6:href="http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/">Running
  Hadoop On Ubuntu Linux (Single-Node Cluster)</link>" provides more details.
  It is also convenience to download a Virtual Machine where Hadoop is setup
  and ready to go. Cloudera provides virtual machines of various formats <link
  ns6:href="https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/Cloudera%27s+Hadoop+Demo+VM">here</link>.
  You can also download the <link
  ns6:href="http://www.greenplum.com/products/greenplum-hd">EMC Greenplum
  HD</link> distribution or get a tech preview of the <link
  ns6:href="http://hortonworks.com/technology/techpreview/">Hortonworks
  distribution</link>.
  Additionally, the <link linkend="appendices">appendix</link> provides information on how to use Spring for Apache Hadoop and setup
  Hadoop with cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services.
