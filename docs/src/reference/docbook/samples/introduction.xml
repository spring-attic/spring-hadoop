	<para>The sample applications have been moved into their own repository so they can be developed independently of the 
	Spring for Apache Hadoop release cycle.  They can be found on GitHub 
	<ulink url="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop-samples/">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop-samples/</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>The <ulink url="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop/wiki/Sample-Projects">wiki page</ulink> for the Spring for Apache Hadoop 
	project has more documentation for building and running the examples and there is also some instructions in the <emphasis>README</emphasis> 
	file of each example.
