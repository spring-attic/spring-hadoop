  <title>Guidance and Examples</title>

  <para>In this Chapter we will provide some guidance on how you can use the
  Spring Hadoop project in conjunction with other Spring projects, starting
  with the Spring Framework itself, then Spring Batch, and then Spring
  Integration.</para>

  <para>Spring Hadoop provides integration with the Spring Framework to create
  and run Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, and Pig jobs as well as work with HDFS and
  HBase. If you have simple needs to work with Hadoop, including basic
  scheduling, you can add the Spring Hadoop namespace to your Spring based
  project and get going quickly using Hadoop.</para>

  <para>As the complexity of your Hadoop application increases, you may want
  to use Spring Batch to regin in the complexity of developing a large Hadoop
  application. Spring Batch provides an extension to the Spring programming
  model to support common batch job scenarios characterized by the processing
  of large amounts of data from flat files, databases and messaging systems.
  It also provides a workflow style processing model, persistent tracking of
  steps within the workflow, event notification, as well as administrative
  functionality to start/stop/restart a workflow. As Spring Batch was designed
  to be extended, Spring Hadoop plugs into those extensibilty points, allowing
  for Hadoop related processing to be a first class citizen in the Spring
  Batch processing model.</para>

  <para>Another project of interest to Hadoop developers is Spring
  Integration. Spring Integration provides an extension of the Spring
  programming model to support the well-known <link
  xlink:href="http://www.eaipatterns.com">Enterprise Integration
  Patterns</link>. It enables lightweight messaging <emphasis
  role="italic">within</emphasis> Spring-based applications and supports
  integration with external systems via declarative adapters. These adapters
  are of particular interest to Hadoop developers, as they directly support
  common Hadoop use-cases such as polling a directory or FTP folder for the
  presence of a file or group of files. Then once the files are present, a
  message is sent internal to the application to do additional processing.
  This additional processing can be calling a Hadoop MapReduce job directly or
  starting a more complex Spring Batch based workflow. Similarly, a step in a
  Spring Batch workflow can invoke functionality in Spring Integration, for
  example to send a message though an email adapter.</para>

  <para>Not matter if you use the Spring Batch project with the Spring
  Framework by itself or with additional extentions such as Spring Batch and
  Spring Integration that focus on a particular domain, you will you benefit
  from the core values that Spring projects bring to the table, namely
  enabling modularity, reuse and extensive support for unit and integration
  testing.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Scheduling</title>

    <para>Spring Batch integrates with a variety of job schedulers and is not
    a scheduling framework. There are many good enterprise schedulers
    available in both the commercial and open source spaces such as Quartz,
    Tivoli, Control-M, etc. It is intended to work in conjunction with a
    scheduler, not replace a scheduler. As a lightweight solution, you can use
    Spring's built in scheduling support that will give you cron like and
    other basic scheduling trigger functionality. See the <link
    xlink:href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/faq.html#schedulers">Task
    Execution and Scheduling</link> documention for more informaiton. A middle
    ground it to use Spring's Quartz integration, see <link
    xlink:href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html#scheduling-quartz">Using
    the OpenSymphony Quartz Scheduler</link> for more information. The Spring
    Batch distribution contains an example, but this documentation will be
    updated to provide some more directed examples with Hadoop, check for
    updates on the <link
    xlink:href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/hadoop">main web site
    of Spring Hadoop</link>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Batch Job Listeners</title>

    <para>Spring Batch let's you attached listeners at the job and step levels
    to perform additional processing. For example, at the end of a job you can
    perform some notification or perhaps even start another Spring Batch Jobs.
    As a brief example, implement the interface <link
    xlink:href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/JobExecutionListener.html">JobExecutionListener</link>
    and configure it into the Spring Batch job as shown below.</para>

    <programlisting language="XML">	&lt;batch:job id="job1"&gt;
		&lt;batch:step id="import" next="wordcount"&gt;
			&lt;batch:tasklet ref="script-tasklet"/&gt;
		&lt;/batch:step&gt;
			
		&lt;batch:step id="wordcount"&gt;
			&lt;batch:tasklet ref="wordcount-tasklet" /&gt;
		&lt;/batch:step&gt;

  &lt;batch:listeners&gt;
    &lt;batch:listener ref="simpleNotificatonListener"/&gt;
  &lt;/batch:listeners&gt;

&lt;/batch:job&gt;
&lt;bean id="simpleNotificatonListener" class="com.mycompany.myapp.SimpleNotificationListener"/&gt;</programlisting>
