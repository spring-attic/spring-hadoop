> **NOTICE: The Spring for Apache Hadoop project will reach End-Of-Life status on April 5th, 2019. We will publish occasional 2.5.x maintenance releases as needed up until that point and will then move the project to the attic. The current Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.5.0 release is built using Apache Hadoop version 2.7.3 and should be compatible with the latest releases of the most popular Hadoop distributions.**

The [Spring for Apache Hadoop](https://projects.spring.io/spring-hadoop/) project provides extensions to 
[Spring](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/), [Spring Batch](https://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/), 
and [Spring Integration](https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/) to build manageable and robust pipeline 
solutions around Hadoop.

Spring for Apache Hadoop extends Spring Batch by providing support for reading from and writing to HDFS, running 
various types of Hadoop jobs (Java MapReduce, Streaming, [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), 
[Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Pig](https://pig.apache.org)) and using [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org). 
An important goal is to provide excellent support for non-Java based developers to be productive using Spring Hadoop 
and not have to write any Java code to use the core feature set.

Spring for Apache Hadoop also applies the familiar Spring programming model to Java MapReduce jobs by providing support 
for dependency injection of simple jobs as well as a POJO based MapReduce programming model that decouples your MapReduce 
classes from Hadoop specific details such as base classes and data types.

# Docs

You can find out more details from the [user documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-hadoop/docs/current/reference/html/) 
or by browsing the [javadocs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-hadoop/docs/current/api/). If you have ideas about how to improve 
or extend the scope, please feel free to contribute.

# Artifacts

For build dependencies to use in your own projects see our [Quick Start](https://projects.spring.io/spring-hadoop/#quick-start) page.

# Building

Spring for Apache Hadoop uses Gradle as its build system. To build the system simply run:

    gradlew

from the project root folder. This will compile the sources, run the tests and create the artifacts. Note that the tests by default 
tries to access a localhost single-node Hadoop cluster. 

## Supported distros

By default Spring for Apache Hadoop compiles against the Apache Hadoop 2.7.x stable relase (hadoop27).

The following distros and versions are currently supported in this projects master branch:

- Apache Hadoop 2.7.x (hadoop27) default
- Apache Hadoop 2.6.x (hadoop26)
- Pivotal HD 3.0 (phd30)
- Cloudera CDH5 (cdh5)
- Hortonworks HDP 2.5 (hdp25)
- Hortonworks HDP 2.4 (hdp24)

(For older distro versions, look for older [releases](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop/releases))

To compile against a specific distro version pass the `-Pdistro=<label>` project property, like so:

    gradlew -Pdistro=hadoop26 build

Note that the chosen distro is displayed on the screen:

    Using Apache Hadoop 2.6.x [2.6.0]

In this case, the specified Hadoop distribution (above Apache Hadoop 2.6.x) is used to create the project binaries.

# CI Builds

The results for CI builds are available at [Spring Data Hadoop: Project Summary - Spring CI](https://build.spring.io/browse/SPRINGDATAHADOOP)

# Testing

For its testing, Spring for Apache Hadoop expects a pseudo-distributed/local Hadoop instalation available on `localhost` configured with a port 
of `8020` for HDFS. The `local` Hadoop setup allows the project classpath to be automatically used by the Hadoop job tracker. These settings 
can be customized in two ways:

* Build properties

From the command-line, use `hd.fs` for the file-system (to avoid confusion, specify the protocol such as 'hdfs://', 's3://', etc - if none is 
specified, `hdfs://` will be used), `hd.rm` for the YARN resourcemanager, `hd.jh` for the jobhistory and `hd.hive` for the Hive host/port 
information, to override the defaults. For example to run against HDFS at `dumbo:8020` one would use:

    gradlew -Phd.fs=hdfs://dumbo:8020 build

* Properties file

Through the `test.properties` file under `src/test/resources` folder (further tweaks can be applied through `hadoop-ctx.xml` file under `src/test/resources/org/springframework/data/hadoop`).

## Enabling Hbase/Hive/Pig/WebHdfs Tests
Note that by default, only the vanilla Hadoop tests are running - you can enable additional tests (such as Hive or Pig) by adding the tasks 
`enableHBaseTests`, `enableHiveTests`, `enablePigTests` or `enableWebHdfsTests` (or `enableAllTests` in short). Use `test.properties` file 
for customizing the default location for these services as well.

## Disabling test execution
You can disable all tests by skipping the `test` task:

    gradlew -x test
